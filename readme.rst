Sony Spresense MicroEJ Platform
===============================
Introduction
============

This is the README file of the reference implementation of the MicroEJ platform for the Spresense board (https://developer.sony.com/develop/spresense).

The Sony Spresense SDK is highly configurable. Any change from the provided configuration must be validated.
The MicroEJ Platform for the Spresense board is delivered as a “Reference Implementation”, with all source included to rebuild the platform and generate a firmware.

The development process is to first configure Sony Spresense’s SDK enabling and/or disabling the features you need and configuring the amount of shared memory you need.
Once you have configured your SDK, you can build the platform, generate a microejapp.o containing the bytecode of your Java application. Then, you need to configure the size of Java Heap used by the application and optimize the resources used by the MicroEJ depending on the RAM available.

For more documentation on how to use MicroEJ SDK, refer to https://developer.microej.com/, in particular the following documents in the resource section:

- Device developer guide
- Application developer guide

The MicroEJ platform is configured with the following features:

- MEJ32 for ARM Cortex-M4 / GCC
- HAL.
- File System on SD Card.
- GUI on LCD Display ILI9340 connected to the SPI Pins
    - Display SCK - Arduino Pin 13
    - Display SDO(MISO) - Arduino Pin 12
    - Display SDI(MOSI) - Arduino Pin 11
    - Display CS - Arduino Pin 10
    - Display D/C - Arduino Pin 9
    - Display RESET - Arduino Pin 8

Step-by-steps Installation
==========================

- Step 0: Configure your bash environment (mostly for WSYS32, Windows Subsystem Linux) and make sure Spresense SDK dependencies are installed
    - The process is described here https://developer.sony.com/develop/spresense/docs/sdk_set_up_en.html#_setup_for_linux
    - When using WSL along a Windows environment be wary of the file permission, :literal:`\r\n` end of line. Look into :literal:`dos2unix` utilities and build-essential

- Step 1: Execute the following line to clone Spresense's SDK, checked out on the correct version (v1.4.0)
    - :code:`$ git clone https://github.com/sonydevworld/spresense.git`
    - :code:`$ cd spresense/`
    - :code:`$ git submodule update --init --recursive`
    - :code:`$ git checkout --recurse-submodules v1.4.0`
    - Step 1.1
        - :code:`$ git submodule add https://github.com/MicroEJ/Platform-Sony-Spresense.git MicroEJ`
    - Step 1.1 - alternative: You can also git clone the MicroEJ folder outside and create a symlink in the spresense folder if you do not want to add a submodule
        - :code:`$ cd ..`
        - :code:`$ git clone https://github.com/MicroEJ/Platform-Sony-Spresense.git MicroEJ`
        - :code:`$ cd spresense`
        - :code:`$ ln -s ../MicroEJ`

-  Step 2 : Install MicroEJ SDK (version 19.05).
    - Step 2.1: Download the SDK evaluation license from http://license.microej.com/ or get a production license. Verifiy that the version of each pack correspond to the versions in "Setup and Versions".
    - Step 2.2 : Install the architecure. Go to Windows -> Preferences -> MicroEJ -> Architecture -> Import...
    - Step 2.3: File -> Import... -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace -> Select root directory -> Point to the MicroEJ directory.
    - Step 2.4: Open the Spresense.platform file. You may configure what is included in the MicroEJ platform in the Content tab by selecting content (or not).
    - Step 2.5: In the Overview tab, click on build platform.

-  Step 3: Create a Java Application.
    - Step 3.1: In MicroEJ SDK either open an existing app or create a new
        - MicroEJ Application with a simple hello world for now

    - Step 3.2: Select the folder of your project (for example :literal:`gui-example` from the getting-started). Then create a new MicroEJ Launcher.
    - Step 3.2: In the tab Execution, check that the selected Platform is correct. Then select "Execute on Simulator". This will run the Java application in the simulator.
    - Step 3.3: In Run -> Run Configuration... -> Tab execution,  check "Execute on Device". This will build a microejapp.o that contains your application.

- Step 4: Make sure the configuration of your SDK and NuttX is correct. For the NuttX configuration use the release configuration and enable the option :literal:`CONFIG_SYSTEMTICK_HOOK=y`.  :literal:`CONFIG_LIBM` must be disabled in the nuttx configuration.
    - **This MicroEJ Platform require a LCD** driver in the Spresense SDK configuration. Without a LCD Driver compiled in the BSP, symbols may be missing.
    - Step 4.1:
        - :code:`$ cd spresense/sdk`.
        - :code:`$ tools/config.py -k release` to configure the kernel using in release mode.
        - :code:`$ tools/config.py -k -m` then select :literal:`RTOS Features -> Clocks and Timers -> System timer hook`
        - Don't forget to save your configuration !
        - Type :code:`make buildkernel` to compile NuttX.
    - Step 4.2 :
        - For the SDK configuration, add :literal:`CONFIG_MICROEJ=y` and :literal:`CONFIG_LIBM_NEWLIB=y`:
            - :code:`$ tools/config.py -m` then select :literal:`Library Routines -> Newlib Math library` and :literal:`Microej -> microej runtime`.
            - Select :literal:`MicroEJ Audio Library LLAPIs` and :literal:`MicroEJ gnss library LLAPIs` if needed
        - Configure the spresense SDK; Enable the properties you need, configure your shared memory (if any), lcd screen (if any).
        - If you want to boot directly on the Java runtime change the entry point to "microej_main". If so, make sure the board ioctl init function :code:`boardctl(BOARDIOC_INIT, 0);` is called (it should be the case by default).
        - Don't forget to save your configuration !
    - Step 4.4: Type :code:`make` to compile your firmware. You can flash it on board following the instruction on Sony Spresense's website https://developer.sony.com/develop/spresense/developer-tools/get-started-using-nuttx/set-up-the-nuttx-environment . There also useful information in the ReadMe of the repository https://github.com/sonydevworld/spresense
    - Step 5: The default configuration should be to define the entry point as "microej_main" in the .config file. You can use NSH as entry point, in which case you need to type the command :code:`microvjm` in the NSH command line. I highly recommand using the default configuration to avoid loading the NSH library for nothing and to avoid a manual command to start your application.

Tasks running
==================================================
When running MicroEJ some tasks will be added to the RTOS.
These are the threads running on top of the existing tasks / threads from NuttX & Spresense SDK :

- UI Task: priority 100, stack size 1024 bytes.
- VM Task: priority 100, stack size 4096 bytes (can be changed using Kconfig, these are the default values).
- pthread GNSS: stack size 512 bytes.
- pthread pool for the file system implementation: 4 threads with 256 bytes stack (configurable).

Some audio tasks from the SDK:
Audio player : priority 150, stack size 3*1024 bytes.
Audio renderer : priority 200, stack size 3*1024 bytes.

Memory Map
==========

Code is stored in flash,executed in RAM.

Memory zone : ram (rwx) :
ORIGIN = 0x0d000000, LENGTH = 1536K, END\_MEMORY=0xd180000

PlatformHeap, Java application Heap, Java Immortals are allocated in the bss zone.

C-heap is the stack of the :code:`Idle` thread, defined relatively to end of the
bss zone. Increasing the size of compiled code (text zone), data (data,
rodata), size of diplay, Java heap(bss) or shared memory (defined
in .config) can break your application on board if not enough memory is available.

Several symptoms may appear, depending on which memory zone is impacted
and the memory allocation you are doing, such as :

- A failure to create task resulting in hardfault in os_startup.
- Code executing stopping without any uart trace.
- Impossibility to create a pthread (or a task), with a return code of 12 corresponding to the errno ENOMEM.

If the board suddenly stops working, this is the FIRST thing you should
check.

Additional Tips
==================================================

- The first time you flash the board you will be directed to download a zip containing a firmware.
- When you flash a new board do not forget to flash the bootloade (read https://developer.sony.com/develop/spresense/developer-tools/get-started-using-nuttx/nuttx-developer-guide#_flashing_bootloader).
- The linker file given in the NuttX repository may not have the correct name. This result in the following error :literal:`arm-none-eabi-ld: cannot open linker script file spresense/sdk/../nuttx/configs/cxd56evb/scripts/gnu-elf.ld: No such file or directory`. To solve this you can simply create a symlink with the expected name :
    - :code:`$ cd spresense//nuttx/configs/cxd56evb/scripts/`
    - :code:`$ ln -s ramconfig.ld gnu-elf.ld`

- There are lots of examples in the SDK! To better understand how to configure your Spresense SDK, start by using the provided example.

- The Spresense SDK is highly configurable. The configuration of the SDK will have a great impact on the amount of RAM available and the functionnalities available. We recommend first configuring your SDK and then starting the integration of your Java application on board. You will have to configure the Java heap and Image heap you use depending on the size of your application and the available ram.

- If some hardfaults occurs, the board do not start or suddenly stops (without any UART trace), asserts fails, it is often due to a lack of RAM. This probably means that your Java application uses too much resources.
  When you use microEJ you add areas in RAM with a fixed size in your Run Configuration... . A wrong size given the Run Configuration... of your Java application can cause problems on-board.
  This is why it is critical to use the simulator to find the minimum resources you can use for your application in RAM and also to correctly configure your Spresense SDK during your development process, if you encounter a bug as previously described the FIRST thing you need to check is how much RAM you use in the Java Heap, Image Heap in your MicroEJ Run Configuration... and how much memory you use in the SDK and-application code.

- When installing kconfig front end for the Spresense SDK setup you may encouter this problem :

If your system has gperf 3.0.4 or earlier, you may safely skip this chapter. gperf 3.1 (released on 5th January of 2017) changed the type used as length argument in generated functions from unsigned int to size_t. This will cause your build to fail with following error message:

::

    CC     libkconfig_parser_la-yconf.lo
    In file included from yconf.c:234:0:
    hconf.gperf:141:1: error: conflicting types for 'kconf_id_lookup'
    hconf.gperf:12:31: note: previous declaration of 'kconf_id_lookup' was here
    static const struct kconf_id *kconf_id_lookup(register const char *str, register unsigned int len);

    make[3]: *** [Makefile:456: libkconfig_parser_la-yconf.lo] Error 1
    make[2]: *** [Makefile:350: all] Error 2
    make[1]: *** [Makefile:334: all-recursive] Error 1
    make: *** [Makefile:385: all-recursive] Error 1

- The procedure to fix is below:
    - :code:`$ curl -O https://gist.githubusercontent.com/KamilSzczygiel/d16a5d88075939578f7bd8fadd0907aa/raw/1928495cfb6a6141365d545a23d66203222d28c0/kconfig-frontends.patch`
    - :code:`$ patch -p1 -i kconfig-frontends.patch`
    - :code:`$ autoreconf -fi`

- To use the Audio and Gnss library in Java you must add to the configuration CONFIG_MICROEJ_AUDIOPLAYER and CONFIG_MICROEJ_GNSS respectively.

- When the MicroEJ project is modified, clean the Spresense SDK directory with make clean & make cleankernel (before flashing the board).

Note on multicore
==================

The MicroEJ runtime environment is executed in internal RAM on the main CPU of the board.
It is perfectly possible to execute code in parallel on other CPU while the MicroEJ runtime environment is running.
